Three mini-utilities related to machine learning projects:

callout() uses flite to announce a message through loudspeakers when a significant point occurs in the learning process

checkcpu() uses system routine "sensors" to measure the temperature of the CPU allowing the learning routine to take action if necessary

checkmem() uses system routine "free" to measure available free memory and take action if available memory is too limited.
