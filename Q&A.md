Anticipated questions in Q&A session:

**Why don't you use an online service such as AWS?** They have rentable faster equipment.

True. Standalone computers are useful in the context of smaller datasets and establishing a good and reliable pipeline which can later be transferred to an online service. It helps to ensure that no runaway processes are uploaded.

**Why don't you get a GPU?**

GPUs are expensive and provide only a marginal improvement in speed of turnaround.

**What alternatives are there to announcing alerts through the speaker system?**

True, you might be in the kitchen making coffee and miss a notification. For important stuff we need an alternative communication method such as an email, text message or a phone call. Automated processes are possible to send email through package SMTPClient or drop a call file into an Asterisk server.

**Temperature control on the CPU is managed by the chip internally with auto shut down. Why bother to control it yourself?**

To maintain the flow of the pipeline, preserve the state of variables and to increase the longevity of the chip.
